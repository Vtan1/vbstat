# vbstat
This project is intended solely for theoretical purposes and not meant to be used seriously as an analysis tool for volleyball teams. To open, go to the analysis folder and run Setup.java

# Purpose
To determine a team's chances of winning by using typical statistics gathered in a volleyball game.

# Instructions
Input each player's statistics in the given text fields. (If not all the fields are filled, the submit button will prompt you to fill them all in before clicking it again.) The program will then enumerate a comparison of both team's statistics, ending in a statement on which team has a higher chance of winning.

# Helpful Tips
- On average, a decent college outside hitter will have around 2 kills per set, and between 5 and 6 attempts.
- Although it may not seem like a lot, typical middle hitters will have around 1 successful block per set.
- Typical setters will have between 5 to 10 assists per set.
- Typical liberos will have between 3 to 7 digs per set.
